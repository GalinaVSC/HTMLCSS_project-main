            <h2>What is time in physics?</h2>
            <p>In classical physics, time is a continuous quantity, an a priori characteristic of the world, not determined by anything. As a basis for measurement, a certain, usually periodic, sequence of events is used, which is recognized as the standard of a certain period of time. The operating principle of the watch is based on this.</p>    
            <p>The new theory is based on the assumption that time is a consequence of entanglement. According to this theory, the only reason an object changes over time is because it is entangled with a clock. Thus, an outside observer would see the universe as completely static and unchanging.</p>
            <p>Time is just a reflection of change. From changes, our brain constructs a sense of time as if it were flowing. According to him, all "the evidence we have for time is encoded in static configurations that we see or experience subjectively, all of which add up together to make time appear linear."</p>
