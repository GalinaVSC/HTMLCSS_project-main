            <p>In the physical sciences, a particle (or corpuscle in older texts) is a small, localized object to which several physical or chemical properties can be attributed, such as volume, density, or mass.</p>    
            <p>They vary greatly in size or importance, from subatomic particles such as the electron, to microscopic particles such as atoms and molecules, to macroscopic particles such as powders and other granular materials.</p>

            <h2>Elementary particle</h2>
            <p>An elementary particle is a collective term that refers to micro-objects on a subnuclear scale, which currently cannot be split into their component parts in practice. The structure and behavior of elementary particles is studied by particle physics.</p>
