### Explanation:
#### What Happens with `display: contents`
- Normally, the `<div>` with the class `container` would act as a parent element with its own box model (margin, border, padding, etc.).
- But by using `display: contents` ,the `<div>`  itself becomes invisible in the layout. It no longer takes up space or contributes visually. However, its children (the `<p>` elements in this case) remain visible and maintain their behavior.
#### Result:
- The `<p>` elements behave as if they were direct children of the `<body>` element.
#### Use Case:
 - `display: contents` is useful in scenarios like accessibility or semantic HTML. For example, you might want to apply certain styles or behaviors to child elements while bypassing the parent container's visual layout.
 #### Caution:
- Not all browsers fully support `display: contents`, and it may disrupt accessibility features (like `aria` attributes or focus management tied to the container).
